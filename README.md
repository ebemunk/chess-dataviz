chess-dataviz
=============

chess-dataviz is a visualization library for chess, written for D3. It has a number of visualizations to show statistics on games, such as:

* Heatmaps on a chess board 
* Openings, sunburst visualization
* Move Paths on a chess board
* Evaluation & Time graph

There are also some scripts in `scripts/` to help parse PGN files (supports *big* files) and scraping game/tournament data from online sources. See `scripts/README.md` for more info on that.

# Install

You can download the files in `dist/` and use them directly, or install via bower:
`bower install chess-dataviz`

You should include `ChessDataViz[.min].js` and `ChessDataViz[.min].css` files. Also make sure you have already included D3 on the page.
